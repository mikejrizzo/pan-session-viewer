# pan-session-viewer

pan-session-viewer is a GUI tool monitoring specific sessions flowing through a Palo Alto Networks firewall.  It is meant to simplify the task of watching sessions that would otherwise require using the CLI or WebUI Session Browser.

The tool provides several useful functions:
* Filter sessions based on search criteria, the same criteria available in the WebUI Session Browser and CLI
* Keeps a running list of sessions in the display, even ones that have been closed
* Double click a session in the display to open a new window showing additional detail

To run the program, just type:

`> python pan-session-viewer.py`

This project is EXPERIMENTAL, created as a side project.  Anybody is free to download and use it, though you'd have to be mad to rely on it for anything critical.

This project is COMPLETELY UNSUPPORTED.
