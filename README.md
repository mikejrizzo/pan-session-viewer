# pan-session-viewer

The pan-session-viewer utility is a tool to monitor specific sessions flowing through a Palo Alto Networks firewall.

This project is EXPERIMENTAL, created as a personal project.  While anybody is free to download and use it, you'd have to be mad to expect it to actually work.  This project is COMPLETELY UNSUPPORTED.
